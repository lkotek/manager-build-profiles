The AutoYaST profile in this section installs a SUSE Linux Enterprise system with all default installation options including a default network configuration using DHCP.
After the installation is finished, a bootstrap script located on the SUSE Manager server is executed in order to register the freshly installed system with SUSE Manager.
You need to adjust the IP address of the SUSE Manager server, the name of the bootstrap script, and the root password according to your environment.
